# Highlights from "The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct For Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin

# Responsibility/Work Ethic

    "Nonprofessionals don't have to take responsibility for the job they do--they leave that ot their employers."

Always attempt to assert responsibility for errors in code. While inevitable, a professional must nonetheles endeavor to write error-free code.

    "As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero. It won't ever get to zero, but it is your responsibility to get as close as possible to it."

The onus of improvement is on your shoulders alone. Your alacrity to learn should be a byproduct of your devotion to the craft and not the sole byproduct of your workload.

    "Your career is your responsibility. It is not your employer's responsibility to make sure you are marketable... It is also not your employer's responsibility to give you the time you need to learn."

Uncle Bob suggests working 60 hours a week. 40 hours dedicated to your employer and 20 hours dedicated to ***yourself***.

    "Professionals spend time caring for their profession"

### *minimal* Suggested Learning that I mostly ~~*don't know*~~ don't know yet:

## Continuous Learning
The rate of software growth will always outpace your own as a developer. It's impossible for most of us (not Abbey) to know everything. The best we can do is to continually challenge ourselves to learn more. Always strive to learn new languages/technologies lest the industry pass you by.

### Mentoring
    "The best way to learn is to teach. Nothing will drive facts and values into your head faster and harder htan having to communicate them to people you are responsible for."

### Know Your Domain
    "It is the worst kind of unprofessinoal behavior to simply code form a spec without understanding why that spec makes sense to the business. Rather, you should know enough about the domain to be able to recognize and challenge specification errors... 
    As you develop a system you need to put yourself in your employer's shoes and make sure that the features you are developing are really going to address your employer's needs."

Know enough about the domain in which you are coding to be able to recognize and _challenge_ specification errors

It's easy to regress to a _us versus them_ attitude with your employer, which doesn't benefit anyone. Your employer's problems are your problems.

Exercise humility on every occasion.

## _Saying No_
    "Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers...
    
    Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But professionals are expected to say no"

Don't focus on adversarial roles, work together to find a suitable compromise. You should aggressively defend your objectives as aggressively as your manager will defend his.
* The "why" is ancillary to the "fact"
* Speak with clarity and concision.
* providing too much detail can be an invitation into micro-management.
* Saying no at the right times and in the right manners (working towards a solution) can often lead to outcomes that will benefit the _team_ (often client and developer)

### Saying Yes
There are three parts to making a commitment:

1. You *say* you'll do it.
2. You *mean* it.
1. You *actually* do it.

#### Language of noncommitment:
* **Need/should**:
  * We need to get this done
  * I need to lose weight.
  * I need to stop smoking.
* **Hope/wish**
  * "I hope to gett this done by tomorrow."
  * "I wish I had time for that"
* **Let's**
  * (my favorite), "Let's table this for tomorrow"

    "What' common in the phrases... is that they either assume things are out of "My" hands or they don't take personal responsibility. In each of these cases people behave as if they were _victims_ of a situation instead of in contorl of it...
    
    The real truth is that you, personally, ALWAYS have somethign that's udner your control, so there is always something you can fully commit to doing."

#### Language of commitment:
  "I will... by..."

  example: "I will finish this feature by Thursday."

  ^"You're not talking about anyone else butt yourself. You're talking about an action that you will take. You won't possibly" take it, or "might get to it"; you will achieve it."

There's no way out of this kind of verbal commitment. Only a binary result is possible.

    "You should only commmit to things that you have full control of."

    "...If you don't tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you're not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment."

## Being a "Team Player"
    "A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own ersponsibilities as well as possible."

A team player is _*not*_ someone who says yes all the time. Having said that, it is unprofessional to remain stuck when help is easily accessible.

## Trying
The danger in responding with "Ok, I'll try." is the ambiguity of the phrase and the lack of clarity that ambiguity lends to your response. Trying is often perceived as a commitment the failure of which will inevitably land on your shoulders.

    "The promise to try is an admission that you've been holding back, that you have a reservoir of extra effort that you can apply. The promise to try is an admission that the goal is attainable through te application of this extra effort; moreover, it is a commitment to apply thtat extra effort to achieve the goal. Therefore, by promising to try you are committing to succeed. This puts the burden on you. If your "trying" does not lead to the desired outcome, you will have failed."

    "...If you are not holding back smoe energy in reserve, if you don't have a new plan, if you aren't goign to chnge your behavior, and if you are reasonably confident in your original estimate, then promising to try is fundamentally dishonest. You are lying."

Professionals are heroes when they "...get a job done well, on time, and on budget."

    "Of all the unprofessional behaviors that a programmer can indulge in, perhaps teh worst of all is saying you are done when you know you aren't."

Think Darryl's definition of **done**...

## Overtime
Uncle Bob contends that you should not agree to work overtime unless:
1. You can personally afford it
1. It is short term, two weeks or less
1. Your boss has a fall-back-plan in case the overtime effort fails.

    "If your boss cannot articulate to you what he's going to do if the overtime effort fails, then you should not agree to work overtime"



# Coding
## Flexible Software
    "The fundamental assumption underlying all software projects is that software is easy to change. If you violate this assumption by creating inflexible structures, then you undercut the economic model that the entire industry is based on."

Write code that has ***flexible structure***, never compromise the structure of the code. Poor structure prolongs the time required ot perform tasks.

    "If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it! The only way to prove that your software is easy to change is to make easy changes to it. And when you find that the changes aren't as easy as you thought, you refine the design so that the next change is easier."

This policy of *"merciless refactoring"* doesn't require sabotaging code but rather implies a sense of improvement and is a testament to the flexibility of the code. Obviously, this practice lends itself to a codebase with automated test suites and a high test coverage percentage.

    "What is dangerous is asllowing the software to remain static. If you aren't flexing it, then when you do ened to chagne it, you'll find it rigid."

Uncle bob contends that code written in the "zone" may come out faster, but you're more likely to refactor/visit that code more.

    "One of the big benefits of pair programming is that it is virtually impossible for a pair to enter the Zone. The Zone is an uncommunicative state, while pairing requires intense and constant communication."

Pairing is also helpful when dealing with interruptions. Your partner can hold the context of the problem at hand while you deal with the interruption. Working together demands communication and communication helps counter writers block.

_*Planned/timed*_ distractions are also immensely helpful.

    "There is something about *disengagement* that allows your mind to hunt for solutions in a different and more creative way."

## Test Driven Development

Alleged benefits:
  * The confidence gained from the certainty provided by having high test coverage
  * Low defect injection rate
  *  The willingness to modify existing code knowing how slow the time for error discovery is.
  *  Most importantly, **DOCUMENTATION**

    "The unit tests are documents. They describe the lowest-level design of the system. They are unambiguous, accurate, written in a language that the audience understands, and are so formal that they execute."

    "...To write these kinds of tests you've got to figure out some way to decouple the function from all the others. In other words, the need to test first forces you to think about good design"

Meanwhile writing tests after the fact is significantly harder. Uncle Bob likens tests written after the fact to *"defense"* and tests written before-hand to *"offense"*.

    "After-the-fact tests are written by someone who is already vested in the code and already knows how the problem was solved."

Test automation pyramid:

    "The intent of the unit tests is to specify the system at the lowest level. Developers write these tests before writing production code as a way to specify what they are about to write."

Component tests cover half the system. They are directed towards happy-path situations and very obvious corner, boundary, and alternate-path cases. (Meanwhile the overwhelming majority of unahppy-path cases are covered by unit tests).

    "Integration tests are choreography tests. They do not test business rules. Rather, they test how well the assembly of components dances together. They are plumbing tests that make sure that the components are properly connected and can clearly communicate with each other.
