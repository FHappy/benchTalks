# Why typescript???

  * (optional) static typing
  * intellisense
  * compiles **_down_** to javascript
  * compatible on all browsers


# Traditional MVC

  MEAN stack:

  ![Traditional MVC Model](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8e3d8f49bac4fd1e3adfa08eed7ebfa4aba0e4fb/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f77434c467363722e706e67)

# @ngrx/store

  One Way Data-Flow:
    (counter example)
  ![One Way Data-Flow](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/14e75038990959e6cf4416ebab162efd66719b86/687474703a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f43364a346361632e706e67)

  ### Core Tenets:
    * state is a single immutable data structure
    * actions describe state changes
    * Pure functions, called reducers take previous state and the next action to compute the new state
    * State accessed with the store, an observable of state and an dobservable of actions 
  
  **_Predictable State Container_** for JS apps that help you write applications that behave _consistently_, run in different environments(i.e. client, server, native, etc.) and are easy to test.

## Advantages:

  1. Centralized, Immutable State
  1. Performance
  1. Testability
  1. Tooling (thank god for ngrx developer tools)

## Promises vs Observables:

| Promises                    | Observables                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| eager, executed immediately | not eager, only executed when subscribed to.  |
| only called once            | called whenever                               |
| asynchronous                | can be asynchronous or synchronous (whoa)     |
| not cancellable             | cancellable                                   |
| only return one value       | can return 0, 1, or more (infinitely?) values |

Observables are better for the "stream" and can be cancelled. Ergo, provides better control, when working with in-flow of values from a "stream".

  `Autocomplete example`

## Subjects

  Are both Observables and Observers, meaning you can subscribe to a Subject, and a Subject can also subscribe to a source.

  **OBSERVERS? OBSERVABLES?** Yes.

  Basically just a function that takes in an _observer_.

  Observer is an object with "next", "error", and "complete" methods on it in some form. Subjects are Observers, so you can call "next" or pass values into the stream directly. Subscribers are then notified of emitted values.

  ```typescript
    const newSubject = new Rx.Subject();

    const firstSubscriber = mySubject.subscribe(x => {
      console.log('first subscriber!!!!11!', val);
    });

    const secondSubscriber = mySubject.subscribe(y => {
      console.log('second subscriber!!!', val);
    });

    mySubject.next('VALUE ONE');
    mySubject.next('VALUE TWO');

  ```

  Operators? More on that in a second.

  In REDUX, convention dictates `dispatch`ing actions to the application store.

  **THE DISPATCHER**

  Also extends subject. adding a `dispatch` method as a passthrough to .next().
  Values are passed **_before_** emitting value to subscribers.


  ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Su0uNQZ.jpg)


  ```typescript
    class Dispatcher extends Rx.Subject {
      dispatch(value: any) : void {
        this.next(value);
      }
    }

    const dispatcher = new Dispatcher();

    const firstSubscriber = mySubject.subscribe(x => {
      console.log('first subscriber!!!!11!', val);
    });

    const secondSubscriber = mySubject.subscribe(y => {
      console.log('second subscriber!!!', val);
    });

    dispatcher.next('VALUE ONE');
    dispatcher.next('VALUE TWO');

  ```

  The Difference?
  
  Subjects: _Only values emitted after subscription are received._

  `Dispatcher = better;`

## Back to Store

  Dispatched actions have to pass through specific pipeline before a new representation of state is passed into the `store`.

  NOTE: FIX LATER WITH DIAGRAM OF PRE-MIDDLEWARE -> REDUCERS -> POST-MIDDLEWARE -> STORE

  Action Pipeline:

  ![Action Pipeline](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/54e4c8b7703d03fa8cddbb1f073b56a2e39f69b8/687474703a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f5a3862396b36552e706e67)

  1. Dispatched Action
  1. Pre-Middleware
  1. Reducers (return new state)
  1. Post-Middleware
  1. store.next(newState)


  Actual store docs:
  ```typescript
  import { SelectSignature } from '@ngrx/core';
  import { Observer } from 'rxjs/Observer';
  import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
  import { Operator } from 'rxjs/Operator';
  import { Action } from './dispatcher';
  import { ActionReducer } from './reducer';
  export declare class Store<T> extends Observable<T> implements Observer<Action> {
      private _dispatcher;
      private _reducer;
      constructor(_dispatcher: Observer<Action>, _reducer: Observer<ActionReducer<any>>, state$: Observable<any>);
      select: SelectSignature<T>;
      lift<R>(operator: Operator<T, R>): Store<R>;
      replaceReducer(reducer: ActionReducer<any>): void;
      dispatch(action: Action): void;
      next(action: Action): void;
      error(err: any): void;
      complete(): void;
  }
  ```

  Reducers?

  (basically our .store files), reducers are functions used to manipulate specific slices of state. Take a `state` and `action` parameter, using a switch statement based on the action type.

  Each time an action is dispatched, each reducer registered to the store is called.

  This occurs via the root reducer, created during the `provideStore` section of imports in the main `app.module.ts`. Linking back to standard reduce function syntax,
  (current state for that state slice is the `accumulator`). If the reducer is registered to handle that `action.type`, the coded calculation happens and a new represtation of state output is returned. Otherwise, the (default) current state for that section is returned unchanged. **IMPORTANT!**

## COOL Observable Operators

  ### mapTo:
  ```typescript

    mapTo(value: any): Observable

  ```

    map to a constant value every time.

  ### debounce:

  ```typescript

    debounce(durationSelector: function): Observable

  ```
  Throw away all emitted values that take less than the specified time (based on the selector function) between output.

  Can also be done with `debounceTime` operator which takes a constant value in milliseconds.

  ### skip:

  ```typescript
    skip(count: Number): Observable
  ```
  Returns observable that skips the first "count" number of items emitted by the source operator.

  ### skipUntil:
  ```typescript
    skipUntil(the: Observable): Observable
  ```
  Skip emitted items from source until inner observable ("the") emits an item. (pretty cool).

  ### race:
  ```typescript
    race(): Observable
  ```

  Take the first observable to emit an action from a list of observables.

  ### let:
  ```typescript
    let(function): Observable
  ```

  Stolen example:

  ```typescript
    const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];
    const myObservableArray = Rx.Observable.fromArray(myArray);
    //demonstrating the difference between let and other operators
    const test = myObservableArray
      .map(val => val + 1)
      //this fails, let behaves differently than most operators
      //val in this case is an observable
      //.let(val => val + 2)
      .subscribe(val => console.log('VALUE FROM ARRAY: ', val));
      
    const letTest = myObservableArray
      .map(val => val + 1)
      //'let' me have the entire observable
      .let(obs => obs.map(val => val + 2))
      .subscribe(val => console.log('VALUE FROM ARRAY WITH let: ', val));

    //let provides flexibility to add multiple operators to source observable then return
    const letTestThree = myObservableArray
      .map(val => val + 1)
      .let(obs => obs
          .map(val => val + 2)
          //also, just return evens
          .filter(val => val % 2 === 0)
        )
      .subscribe(val => console.log('let WITH MULTIPLE OPERATORS: ', val));

    //pass in your own function to add operators to observable
    const obsArrayPlusYourOperators = (yourAppliedOperators) => {
      return myObservableArray
        .map(val => val + 1)
        .let(yourAppliedOperators)
    };
    const addTenThenTwenty = obs => obs.map(val => val + 10).map(val => val + 20);
    const letTestFour = obsArrayPlusYourOperators(addTenThenTwenty)
      .subscribe(val => console.log('let FROM FUNCTION:', val));
  ```

# Other cool stuff I found

Problem: Running code after a particular action has fired.

Solutions?
  * add another key to the state (e.g. `{isSuccessful: boolean}` )
  * use ngrx/effects and the @Effect() decorator
  * subscribe to the dispatcher (i.e. a custom one, and list it as a provider in app.module.ts)
